# Beatbox VST instrument

I'm learning how to make instruments with [HISE](https://github.com/christophhart/HISE)

It includes a kick, snare, hihat (open, closed and choke) and a crash

You can't, because I have not included the samples. Sorry.

But you can make your own and look at the **SampleMaps** for information about audiofiles needed.
